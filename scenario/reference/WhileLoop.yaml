# WhileLoop
#
# Primitive to loop over a condition.
#
# This is the main user of expression of evalexpr. It enables to loop over a
# condition executing steps in the loop.
#
# The condition must be a evalexpr returning a boolean, such as :
#  - reply_nth(3) == 0x40
#  - true
#  - (a < 3) && (len(reply) >= 3) && (reply_nth(2) == 0x40)
#
# The allowed steps are the same as in the main scenario, allowing therefore
# nested loops, etc..
#

# Form 1: a for loop reading a DID 2 times
- !WhileLoop
  condition: a < 3
  steps:
  - !ReadDID
    did: 0xf190
  - !EvalExpr
    expression: a = a + 1;

# Form 2: a while loop, waiting for a read DID to return a speciifc value
- !WhileLoop
  condition: (reply_nth(0) & 0x40) == 0x40
  steps:
  - !ReadDID
    did: 0xf190
  - !SleepMs 1000
