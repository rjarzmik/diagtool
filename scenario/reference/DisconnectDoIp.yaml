# DisconnectDoIp
#
# Primitive to force a DoIP disconnection. The DoIP communication will be
# attempted to reconnect automatically either after a duration or immediately.
#
# This primitive is usefull after ordering an ECU to reboot, such as with an UDS
# command "10 02", if the remote ECU doesn't break properly the TCP/DoIP socket.

# Form 1: Disconnect, wait 1 second, as try to reconnect after.
- !DisconnectDoIp
  wait_after_ms: 1000

# Form 2: Disconnect, and immediately try to reconnect.
- !DisconnectDoIp
  wait_after_ms: null
