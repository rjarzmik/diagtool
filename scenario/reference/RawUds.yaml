# RawUds
#
# Send an UDS command of bytes rather than something like ReadDID,...
#
# This enables any kind of UDS command, even these not representing an actual
# UDS command. This is also another way to do a ReadDiD or WriteDiD command.

# Form 1: Equivalent of ReadDID did: 0xf190
- !RawUds
  data: !Bytes 22 f1 90

# Form 2: Get the UDS command from raw_file.bin, and send it
- !RawUds
  data: !BinFileName raw_file.bin

# Form 3: Get the UDS command from a variable computed by a EvalExpr expression
- !RawUds
  data: !EvalExprVarname request
