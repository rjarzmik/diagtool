# WriteDID
#
# Writes a specific DID.
#
# The DID value can either be specified, or read back from a file. The file is
# read when executing the instruction, meaning that if the file changes between
# 2 WriteDID, the written DID will be different.

# Form 1: Write a DID with an exact immediate value.
- !WriteDID
  did: 0xf190
  data: !Bytes 56 46 31 46 52 53 59 53 42 45 4e 43 48 30 31

# Form 2: Write a DID with an exact value read from a file.
#         Be aware that the file is taken byte by byte. Therefore a terminating
#         \n will result in a byte of value 10.
- !WriteDID
  did: 0xf190
  data: !BinFileName toto.bin

# Form 3: Write a DID from an EvalExpr variable value.
- !WriteDID
  did: 61840
  data: !EvalExprVarname vin
